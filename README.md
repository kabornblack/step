Project Overview
The React Step is a React-based web application designed to guide users through a series of messages. Each step represents a message, and users can navigate forward and backward through the steps using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The messages are predefined in the messages array within the App.js file.

## The main features of this application include:
-
Displaying messages step by step.
-
Navigating between messages using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
-
A close button to toggle the visibility of the guide.
